# Summoner Sneaked
##Responsive Web Application for quickly scouting summoner detail in League of Legend.

This is the URL: http://summonersneaked.azurewebsites.net/


**Version 0.2 Update 15/09/2016**
* More responsive searching and feedback.
* Enter key can be used to initiate the search.
* Fail cases are now appeared as short duration time window, before the messege disappear.
* Auto re-highlight the text for quick re-typing.
* Background change to a much more vibrant and colourful image to fit league theme.


**IMPORTANT**
* Due to recent changes to Riot game API, you can no longer make a client side call, therefore this app is currently not responsive. I have tried using CORS to go around this issue, but the server doesn't allow this. A work around is still being figured out.
